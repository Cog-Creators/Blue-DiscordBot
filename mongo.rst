How to install MongoDB for Red - Discord Bot
==========================================

MongoDB is optional for Red but you can install it to increase performances (in fact I don't know what it does, replace this line with the real reason. Please)

Install for Windows
-------------------

1) Install `MongoDB Community Server for Windows`_ with SSL support.
_MonogoDB Community Server for Windows : https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community

2) Locate the file just downloaded (often in /Downloads), run the .msi file and follow the steps for installation

3) Set up MongoDB by opening a Command Prompt (Win + R : cmd) and type ::
        md /data/db

4) Start MongoDB by typing in a Command Prompt::
        "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe"

5) Connect to MongoDB by opening another Command Prompt and type::
        "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe"

MongoDB is now running on your computer!
