docstrings for command help can optionally handle whitespace
slightly differently to accommodate ease of writing good help.
You can enable this using the `adjust_help_whitespace` kwarg in the command constructor
or by passing that as a kwarg to cogs. When enabled:
  - Singular newlines will be treated as line continuations
  - groups of newlines will have their last newline removed.
