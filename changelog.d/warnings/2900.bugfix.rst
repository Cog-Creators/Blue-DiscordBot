Remove a ``is_admin_or_superior`` check so the permissions cog can change who can check other user's warnings.
- Changes ``[p]warnings`` to be admin or higher, and now ``[p]warnings`` is **only** used for other user's warnings.
- Adds in ``[p]mywarnings`` as a substitute for ``[p]warnings`` not allowing users to check their own warnings.
