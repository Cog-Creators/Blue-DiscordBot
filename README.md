> **Red** is a fully modular bot which comes with sets of features/commands that can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it customizable exactly how you want.  
You can turn Red into a trivia bot, an admin bot, a music bot (...) or all of these together.  

The default set of modules includes and it's not limited to:
* Moderation features (kick/ban/softban, filters, mod-log...)
* Trivia (lists included and you can make new ones!)
* Music features (playlists, youtube, soundcloud, queues...)
* Stream alerts (twitch/hitbox)
* Slot machines (yes, really!)
* Custom commands
* Imgur/gif search
* And much much more
