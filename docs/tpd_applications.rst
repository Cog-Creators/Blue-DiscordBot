Cog Creator Application Process
===============================

This document details the process, requirements, and benefits of the  Red Bot V3 third-party creator program.
It supersedes the previous V2 program, which is no longer in use. This system is monitored and controlled by the Red QA team, under the
direction of the Red Core Developers.

***********
Roles
***********
By participating in this program, you have the opportunity to attain one of two of our developer roles, Cog Creator and Senior Cog Creator. These roles are given sequentially. Meaning you must first be a Cog Creator to qualify for Senior Cog Creator. Red's core developers and QA reserve to right to revoke these roles and all privileges if you are found to be in gross negligence, malicious intent, or reckless abandonment of your repository.

Cog Creator
^^^^^^^^^^^
Cog Creators are those who have made it through the initial application process. They have shown that they can meet the minimum standards required to create safe and reliable content for the community. 

The recipient of this role is then granted the following amenities:

 - Approved tag on the Red V3 Portal. (Currently under construction)
 - Added to a growing, curated list of recommended repositories (temporary until V3 portal is complete).
 - The Cog Creator role on the main Red Server and the cog support server.
 - Access to an additional testing channel and V3-Burndown on the main Red Server.
 - Access to the cog creators channel on the support server.
 - Given a badge and profile icon to display on Cog Board.
 - Alerted on breaking changes in Red before anyone else.

Senior Cog Creator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Senior level cog creators are previous junior level creators who have shown exponential growth or are a highly qualified programmer. They must have demonstrated a willingness to learn and communicate effectively. Senior level cog creators have also passed the second application process which is much more strict on code quality and includes an emphasis on character and integrity. Senior cog creators are considered mentors to the more junior developers. This is also a stepping stone for becoming a QA member.

The recipient of this role is then granted the following amenities:  

- A dedicated support channel on the Red Cog Support server.
- Senior Cog Creator role on the Main Red server and the Support server.
- Access to the advance coding channel on the main red server.
- Added to the senior developer group on Cog Board, new profile badge and icon.
- All previous cog creator perks


****************
Approval
****************
Submissions for the Cog Creator program will be placed on the `Cog Board <https://cogboard.red/c/apps>`_. Each application has it's own set of requirements. In an effort to show transparency, your application and comments will be visible to the public. For a full list of our requirements, :doc:`read here <../tpd_requirements>`.

You will submit an application on the Cog Board in the Applications category. Please include your discord name, a link to the repository, and a brief description of what your repository is about. Feel free to include any other additional information that may aid in the review of your work.

A QA member will then be assigned to your application. The number of applicants, holidays, and other unforeseen circumstances may cause delays in the processing of your application. Please refrain from messaging QA or other Red staff members about your application. All communication should go through the Cog Board.

Once a QA member has conducted a final review, you will have up to 14 days to make the necessary changes. Your commit history will be used to verify that you made these changes. Let the QA member know, on your application post, once you have made the requested changes. If everything is in order, then your application will be approved.

We encourage applicants to communicate with the QA team. If you are unsure of how to fix a problem, you should direct your inquires to the reviewer.

If your application is rejected, don't fret! You can always reapply. We ask that you wait at a minimum of 14 days before reapplying, unless otherwise specified. Focus on fixing or improving on the points that were addressed in your initial application. When you go to reapply, just follow the same steps. 

Once you are approved, a QA member will close and lock your application. You will then be granted all of the benefits of the cog creator role. 

.. important::

    Please allow up to 24 hours for these changes to go into effect. Most of the time, we can grant you all of the benefits as outlines 
    above, but it may take some additional coordination to provide all of the amenities. If you feel you are missing something, send a 
    direct message to the approving official of your application.

Senior Cog Creator Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Senior Cog Creators will go through a similar, but more strict review process. QA will review not only the repository, but the applicant's character. Unlike the previous process, the QA team will conduct a comprehensive review as a group. It is expected that the applicant meet all or most of the requirements before submission. If the team finds any discrepancies in your repository, you will be notified via a reply. Once these changes are met, if any, a final review will be made internally based on your character, moral standing in the community, leadership qualities, and overall contribution to the project. You must receive a majority vote from the QA team. If you pass, then your application is recommended for approval to the core developers. You only need one developer's approval.

Senior is a big leap from cog creator. We expect members of this group to be leaders, but most of all, mentors to the more junior developers. As a Senior cog creator you are given a voice to give your input on how design decisions may impact third party development. This is considered a stepping stone to QA.

Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

What happened to the approved/beta/unapproved list?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This system was really confusing and has been simplified to a two category system. Unapproved repositories are simply, repos that have not been vetted by the QA team, and may contain malicious, vulnerable, or broken cogs. Approved repos are those the QA team found to be in compliant and should function safely and as intended.

I'm a l33t haxor programmer. My repo has more stars than the audience at the golden globes. Alan Turing is my great great great grand pappy. Can you just promote me directly to senior?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No. We make all applicants, including the core developers, staff, and any ancillary members go through the same process. So grab a number and get in line!

Hello? Is anyone out there? I posted my application three days ago, and still haven't received a response!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hi. We hear you. It takes time to review, test, and compile a list of changes. QA members are volunteers and they do this job for free in their spare time. Be patient, you application will get looked at. If several weeks go by, and you still do not have a response, please send the QA team a message and they will follow-up.


My application was rejected. Now what?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just because your application was rejected, doesn't mean you can't be a cog creator. Follow the recommendations the QA member gave in their final review. Hone your craft, and tie up any loose ends. Then, apply again. There isn't any penalty for having to apply more than once, other than the mandatory wait period, which is 14 days, unless otherwise specified by your reviewer.


I think my reviewer is out to get me! Can someone else review my application?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No. The reviewer of your application has the final word. When it comes to rejecting an application, the decision is talked about internally. We try not to make these decisions lightly, because a lot of time is usually spent looking over your work, and if there is something we feel you could fix quickly without having to resubmit all over again, we will elect to do that. If you truly feel you have been wronged, you can submit a formal complaint on the Cog Board by reporting your application. You will need to detail all the reasons you feel a bias was taken against you.


My repo was approved, but I still don't have my role. What do I do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It may take up to 24 hours for all of your perks to awarded. If you still haven't received everything, please contact the QA member who approved your application.

Is this process harder than the old one?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes and no. The old process had a lot of arbitrary and subjective mechanisms in place that prevented a lot of people from having an actual review. With the simplified listings, standardization, a review team, and documentation on exactly what you need to be approved, has made the process smoother. While the list of items we require a repository to have may seem lengthy, it all reduces to three core principles: Is the repository in question safe, compliant, and not broken?

How long should I wait before applying for senior?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should wait, at a minimum, six months from your approval to cog creator. We want to see growth and get to know who you are. The community needs time to know you as well. Promoting someone to senior is not something that we take lightly. It's important to note that with the two category system (Approved and Unapproved) your repository isn't going to see a boost in numbers with this promotion. It's just about seniority in terms of time spent, but also in wisdom and knowledge.

Can I still submit a v2 repository?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No. We have moved on, and so should you.

My cogs are worked on with a team, can I still submit?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes. You are still required to follow all of the rules, but you must put each author's name, where applicable, in the info.json. Make sure users have a good way to contact your group about issues as well.

These requirements seem a bit much. Do you really expect us to meet them all?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yes. The requirements are designed to help the community, not to weed people out per se. Look at some of the other applications that have passed. We try to maintain transparency and you can view the entire review conducted for any applicant. We believe in you!

One of my cogs is NSFW. Does that mean my entire repo is NSFW?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No. Just that one cog is NSFW and should be declared as such in the installation msg of that particular cog.
