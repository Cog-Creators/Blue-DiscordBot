This cog provides commands to check if a channel 
on a supported streaming service is live as well 
as to create and manage alerts for channels.

Supported streaming services are:

Youtube and Twitch both require setting authentication 
details for commands for those services to work. See 
``[p]streamset twitchtoken`` and ``[p]streamset youtubekey``
