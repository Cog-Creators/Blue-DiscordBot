Core
====

This is the cog guide for the core cog. You will
find detailed docs about usage and commands.

``[p]`` is considered as your prefix.

.. note:: This cog is not like the other cogs. It is loaded by default, not
    included in the cogs paths and it cannot be unloaded. It contains the
    core commands necessary for Red.

.. _core-usage:

-----
Usage
-----

The Core cog is the base of Red. It contains the essential functions, such
as managing the cogs, restart the bot, leave servers, set the locale...

The cog cannot be unloaded, but most of the commands are made for the
:ref:`bot owner <getting-started-permissions>` and won't be seen by the
other users in the help command.

.. _core-commands:

--------
Commands
--------

Since this is a huge cog, the commands are sorted in these hidden
categories:

* System

* Cog management

* Red settings (include bot user)

* Server and user management

* User commands (not restricted to the bot owner)
