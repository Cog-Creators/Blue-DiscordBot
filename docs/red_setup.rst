Setting up your instance
------------------------

Run :code:`redbot-setup` and follow the prompts. It will ask first for where you want to
store the data (the default is :code:`~/.local/share/Red-DiscordBot`) and will then ask
for confirmation of that selection. Next, it will ask you to choose your storage backend
(the default here is JSON). It will then ask for a name for your instance. This can be
anything as long as it does not contain spaces; however, keep in mind that this is the
name you will use to run your bot, and so it should be something you can remember.
