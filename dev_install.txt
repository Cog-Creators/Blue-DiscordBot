# This is a pip requirements file used to quickly set up a development
# environment for Red. Make sure you're using a virtual environment, and
# simply run `pip install -r dev_install.txt` to get set up.
#
# Red will be installed in "editable" or "develop" mode, meaning that
# the package installation itself is actually located here, in this
# project directory, and each time you run Red, it will run directly
# from these sources.
