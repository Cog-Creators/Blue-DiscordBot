# How to install MongoDB for Red - Discord Bot

MongoDB is optional for Red but you can install it to increase performances (in fact I don't know what it does, replace this line with the real reason. Please). Also I know I had to make a .rst but I made a .md just to write the doc

## Install for Windows

1. Install [MongoDB Community Server for Windows](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community) with SSL support.

2. Locate the file just downloaded (often in `/Downloads`), run the `.msi` file and follow the steps for installation

3. Set up MongoDB by opening a Command Prompt (Win + R : cmd) and type

```
md /data/db
```

4. Start MongoDB by typing in a Command Prompt

```
"C:Program FilesMongoDBServer3.4binmongod.exe"
```

5. Connect to MongoDB by opening another Command Prompt and type

```
"C:Program FilesMongoDBServer3.4binmongod.exe"
```

MongoDB is now running on your computer!
